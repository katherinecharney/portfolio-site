                <p>In order to design and market effective products, understanding the target audience is essential. Personas are fictional, generalized representations of ideal users, which help guide design decisions and provide a clear focus on the audience's needs, goals, behaviors, and pain points. Developing accurate personas requires extensive research and empathy for the target users..</p></div>
