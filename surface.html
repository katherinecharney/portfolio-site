                <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
                <p>The Surface brand underperformed in the competitive laptop device category because users lacked a strong emotional connection to the product.</p></div>

                <h3>HYPOTHESIS</h3>
                <p>By connecting users with the everyday people who design and use Surface devices, we build trust and foster a deeper connection through creativity and curiosity, making each device feel as if it's crafted by the very individuals who will ultimately use them.</p></div>

                <h3>RESEARCH</h3>
                <p>I conducted direct and indirect competitor audits of long-form content and product strategy; equally important to storyline was product styling. Through in-depth research I identified the knolling design technique as a potential solution for building trust and engagement in the product. Competitors have displayed their device components as 3D models, but rarely through photographic means. This approach celebrates the ingenuity of designers and engineers by shedding light on their meticulous process and fostering a deeper appreciation for the technology they create.</p></div>

                <h3>STORYLINE</h3>
                <p>Collaborating closely with videographers, editors, and colorists during post-production, I ensured the Surface product was central to each storyline.Whether it was emphasizing the precision of the trackpad during a design demo, capturing the tactile feedback of the keyboard in a close-up shot, or focusing on the vibrant clarity of the screen while showcasing creative workflows, every detail was carefully considered to highlight the product's innovative features.</p></div>

                <h3>VISUAL DIRECTION</h3>
                <p>From the color palette to the typography, every visual element was meticulously crafted to reflect the Surface brand. The series' aesthetic drew inspiration from clean lines and modern design of the device itself, emphasizing simplicity, elegance, and functionality. These choices weren't just about looking good—they ensured the story flowed naturally, keeping the focus on the product. Ultimately, the visuals became an extension of Surface's design ethos, bringing the technology to life in a way that was both polished and intuitive. This design system extended across multiple touchpoints, from the website to social media assets and promotional materials, creating a cohesive brand experience throughout.</p></div>

                <p>In 2024 the project was honored with two Webby Awards in the long-form content and brand strategy categories, recognizing our innovative approach to design and storytelling. The awards underscored the success of our product storytelling to elevate the Surface brand and create lasting connections with the audience.</div>
